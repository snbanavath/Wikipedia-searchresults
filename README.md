# Wikipedia-searchresults
This is a simple web page which can bring the search results of a keyword entered from wikipedia. Here I have used HTTP and API calls in JavaScript to fetch the results. You can also see a spinner spinning when there's a short delay in fetching and displaying the results.
The Fetched results parsed, styled and arranged properly in the webpage which looks like Google Search Results.
